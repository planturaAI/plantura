        this is an tested prompt from u:That's not Mercurialis annua L. That's a Epipremnum aureum, commonly known as a Golden Pothos.

The image shows a healthy Epipremnum aureum. The leaves are a vibrant green with yellow variegation, indicating good light conditions. The stems appear strong and flexible. There are no visible signs of pests or diseases. Overall vitality is excellent.

Care Recommendations:
Light: Bright, indirect light is ideal. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves.
Watering: Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.
Soil: Well-draining potting mix is essential.
Humidity: Prefers moderate to high humidity. Consider grouping with other plants or using a pebble tray to increase humidity.
Fertilizing: Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer).
Pruning: Prune as needed to maintain shape and size. Propagate cuttings easily in water.
Interesting Facts about Epipremnum aureum (Golden Pothos):
Air purification: NASA research suggests Pothos can help filter indoor air.
Low maintenance: Extremely tolerant of neglect, making it a great plant for beginners.
Toxicity: Toxic to cats and dogs if ingested. Keep out of reach of pets.
Versatile: Can be grown in hanging baskets, as a trailing plant, or trained to climb a support.

dont say the plant name! just starting talking about the health and other things just start with this name "{get_common_name(plant_name, gemini_model)}" pick one if there is multiple names.
